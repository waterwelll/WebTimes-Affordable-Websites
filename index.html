        <p>
            Kenny Steyn established GreenTree Technologies in 2007 
            due to the need for IT solutions to business problems, 
            however it did not take long to establish that many 
            businesses were looking for IT solutions to address a 
            business problem. Kenny began to address business problems 
            first, thus eliminating vast amounts of unnecessary expenses 
            on a solution that would not really address the issue at hand. 
            This then allowed for additional budget to be used for IT to 
            improve business thus making a significant impact on the bottom line.

            <br><br>
            Kenny is an ordinary kind of guy with a very extraordinary way of 
            thinking and analyzing problems. After a coffee with him, you will 
            come away excited, energized, enthusiastic and encouraged. He has 
            the ability to make complex situations clearer and impossible 
            situations, POSSIBLE.
